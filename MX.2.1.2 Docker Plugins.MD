# Docker Plugins
## Container Plugins
- **Isolation customization**: in the context of container orchestration systems like Kubernetes, isolation customization refers to the ability to adjust how pods (containers) are isolated from each other and the underlying infrastructure; this can involve setting up network policies, security contexts, and resource quotas to ensure that containers operate securely and efficiently.
- **Volumes**: volumes are a mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.; they allow data to survive beyond the lifecycle of a single container instance, facilitating data persistence and sharing among containers.
- **Secrets**: Secrets are used to store sensitive information such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys; they are designed to be tightly controlled and secure, ensuring that secrets are not exposed outside where they are intended to be used.
- **Networks**: networking is a passage through which all the isolated container communicate - there are mainly five network drivers in Docker (such as bridge, host, none, overlay, and macvlan); in Docker, networking is indeed a crucial component that allows isolated containers to communicate with each other.
